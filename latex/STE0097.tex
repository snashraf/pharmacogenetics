\textbf{\colorbox{cyan} {Class 3}} \textbf{ rs2242480 } \textit{ CC }
Patients with genotype CC may have decreased severity of opioid withdrawal symptoms and side effects when treated with methadone in people with Heroin Dependence as compared to patients with genotype TT or CT. Other genetic and clinical factors may also influence the response to methadone.\newline\textbf{\colorbox{cyan} {Class 3}} \textbf{ rs3735451 } \textit{ TT }
Patients with the TT genotype who are heroin dependent may have less severe side effects and opioid withdrawal symptoms when treated with methadone as compared to patients with the CC genotype. Other genetic and clinical factors may also influence side effects and opioid withdrawal symptoms in patients receiving methadone.\newline\subsection{ clopidogrel }\subsubsection{ MED12L }
\textit{ mediator complex subunit 12-like }

\textbf{\colorbox{cyan} {Class 3}} \textbf{ rs2046934 } \textit{ AA }
Patients with the AA genotype may have increased risk of adverse cardiac events when treated with clopidogrel as compared to patients with genotype GG. Other genetic and clinical factors may also influence the response to clopidogrel.\newline\subsubsection{ P2RY12 }
\textit{ purinergic receptor P2Y, G-protein coupled, 12 }

\textbf{\colorbox{cyan} {Class 3}} \textbf{ rs2046934 } \textit{ AA }
Patients with the AA genotype may have increased risk of adverse cardiac events when treated with clopidogrel as compared to patients with genotype GG. Other genetic and clinical factors may also influence the response to clopidogrel.\newline\subsubsection{ ABCB1 }
\textit{ ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B (MDR/TAP), member 1 }

\textbf{\colorbox{cyan} {Class 3}} \textbf{ rs1045642 } \textit{ GG }
People with GG  genotype may have decreased, but not absent, risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE such as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) when treated with clopidogrel in people with acute coronary syndrome or myocardial Infarction as compared to people with genotypes AA. Contradictory findings have been reported in the literature. Other genetic and clinical factors may also impact the response to clopidogrel.\newline\end{document}
