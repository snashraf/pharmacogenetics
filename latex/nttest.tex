If this document has compiled and your tree looks okay, then \textsf{newicktree} has been successfully installed on your system!

If the document compiled but the tree does not look okay, then it is possible that you are using a dvi preview to view / print the document.  Please use a dvi-ps converter (preferably dvips) to generate a PostScript file, and try looking at that.
