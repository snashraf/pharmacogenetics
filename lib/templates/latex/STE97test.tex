\item at the time of this writing, there are no data available on the possible role of DPYD*2A, *13, or variant:rs67376798 in 5-fluorouracil toxicities in pediatric patient populations,  however, there is no reason to suspect that DPYD variant alleles would affect 5-fluorouracil metabolism differently in children compared to adults. \newline
\item Excerpt from the fluoropyrimidine dosing guideline based on DPYD genotype: \newline
\item The strength of the dosing recommendations is based on the fact that some variants (DPYD*2A, *13, and variant:rs67376798) clearly affect DPD activity, and DPD activity is clearly related to 5-fluorouracil clearance, and 5-fluorouracil exposure is associated with its toxic effects. Therefore, reduction of fluoropyrimidine dosage in patients with these variants may prevent severe and possibly life-threatening toxicities. However, available evidence does not clearly indicate a degree of dose reduction needed to prevent fluoropyrimidine related toxicities...Based on literature review (see full manuscript), our recommendation is to start with at least a 50\% reduction of the starting dose followed by an increase in dose in patients experiencing no or clinically tolerable toxicity to maintain efficacy, a decrease in dose in patients who do not tolerate the starting dose to minimize toxicities or pharmacokinetic guided dose adjustments (if available). Patients who are homozygous for DPYD*2A, *13, or variant:rs67376798 may demonstrate complete DPD deficiency and the use of 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine is not recommended in these patients.,   \newline

This is important because DPYD is on the minus chromosomal strand and variant:rs67376798 is a T/A snp.  Therefore, the T allele on the gene confers the deficiency, while the complement on the positive chromosomal strand (A allele) is indicative of deficiency. \newline

\item Table 1: Recommended therapeutic use of ivacaftor based on CFTR genotype \newline
\item Adapted from Table 2 of the 2014 guideline manuscript (May 2016 Update on PharmGKB).  Variants have been added to the table below that are not in the published 2014 guideline or supplement,  specifically, variants other than G551D and F508del. \newline
\item a These recommendations are based on treatment of CF patients with ivacaftor alone and current evidence. Clinical trials are currently underway to investigate ivacaftor alone or in combination with other drugs to treat CF patients with CFTR variants other than G551D, therefore there is potential that ivacaftor may be effective in these patients. See the 2014 guidelines for further details. \newline
\item b The recommendation for patients with the F508del/F508del genotype is based on ivacaftor mechanism of action and clinical observational data. The clinical study however was a safety study and was not powered to detect a difference in efficacy PMID: 22383668. \newline
\item c Rating scheme described in the 2014 supplement. \newline
\item d Variants listed in this table include those added to the updated drug label for ivacaftor(/label/PA166104890). The modifications to this table were made after the acceptance of publication of the 2014 CPIC Ivacaftor-CFTR guideline PMID: 24598717 and are not reflected in the PDFs of the CPIC guideline main manuscript or supplement.  \newline

\item Adapted from Figure 1 of the 2014 guideline manuscript (May 2016 Update on PharmGKB).  Variants have been added to this figure that are not in the published 2014 guideline or supplement,  specifically, variants other than G551D and F508del. Additionally, the age has been updated to 2 years old or older from 6 years and older, due to an update in the FDA-approved drug label for ivacaftor. \newline
\item !Adapted diagram from Figure 1(IvacaftorFigure1May2016Update.png) \newline
\item e Ivacaftor is not recommended for CF patients with other CFTR variants or in patients homozygous for the F508del variant (see 2014 guideline for further details, supporting evidence and disclaimers). Future clinical trials for other CFTR variants are ongoing. \newline

\item at the time of this writing, there are no data available on the possible role of DPYD*2A, *13, or variant:rs67376798 in 5-fluorouracil toxicities in pediatric patient populations,  however, there is no reason to suspect that DPYD variant alleles would affect 5-fluorouracil metabolism differently in children compared to adults. \newline
\item Excerpt from the fluoropyrimidine dosing guideline based on DPYD genotype: \newline
\item The strength of the dosing recommendations is based on the fact that some variants (DPYD*2A, *13, and variant:rs67376798) clearly affect DPD activity, and DPD activity is clearly related to 5-fluorouracil clearance, and 5-fluorouracil exposure is associated with its toxic effects. Therefore, reduction of fluoropyrimidine dosage in patients with these variants may prevent severe and possibly life-threatening toxicities. However, available evidence does not clearly indicate a degree of dose reduction needed to prevent fluoropyrimidine related toxicities...Based on literature review (see full manuscript), our recommendation is to start with at least a 50\% reduction of the starting dose followed by an increase in dose in patients experiencing no or clinically tolerable toxicity to maintain efficacy, a decrease in dose in patients who do not tolerate the starting dose to minimize toxicities or pharmacokinetic guided dose adjustments (if available). Patients who are homozygous for DPYD*2A, *13, or variant:rs67376798 may demonstrate complete DPD deficiency and the use of 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine is not recommended in these patients.,   \newline

\item c Note that the rs67376798A allele refers to the allele on the positive chromosomal strand.  This is important because DPYD is on the minus chromosomal strand and variant:rs67376798 is a T/A snp.  Therefore, the T allele on the gene confers the deficiency, while the complement on the positive chromosomal strand (A allele) is indicative of deficiency. \newline

These papers have prompted several opinion pieces PMID: 24328463, 24251364. The authors are evaluating the information, which will be incorporated into the next update of the CPIC guideline on warfarin. \newline
\item October 2011 \newline

\item These guidelines are applicable to: \newline
\item adult patients \newline
\item Excerpt from the 2011 warfarin dosing guideline: \newline
\item Pharmacogenetic algorithm-based warfarin dosing: Numerous studies have derived warfarin dosing algorithms that use both genetic and non-genetic factors to predict warfarin dose PMID: 18305455, 19228618, 18574025. Two algorithms perform well in estimating stable warfarin dose across different ethnic populations,  PMID: 18305455, 19228618 these were created using more than 5,000 subjects. Dosing algorithms using genetics outperform nongenetic clinical algorithms and fixed-dose approaches in dose prediction PMID: 18305455, 19228618. The best way to estimate the anticipated stable dose of warfarin is to use the algorithms available on http://www.warfarindosing.org (offering both high-performing algorithms PMID: 18305455, 19228618). The dosing algorithm published by the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium is also online, at IWPC Pharmacogenetic Dosing Algorithm(https://github.com/PharmGKB/cpic-guidelines/raw/master/warfarin/2011/IWPCdosecalculator.xls). The two algorithms provide very similar dose recommendations.,  \newline
\item Approach to pharmacogenetic-based warfarin dosing without access to dosing algorithms:     In 2007, the FDA modified the warfarin label, stating that CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes may be useful in determining the optimal initial dose of warfarin PMID:17906972. The label was further updated in 2010 to include a table (Table 1) describing recommendations for initial dosing ranges for patients with different combinations of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes. Genetics-based algorithms also better predict warfarin dose than the FDA-approved warfarin label table PMID:21272753. Therefore, the use of pharmacogenetic algorithm-based dosing is recommended when possible, although if electronic means for such dosing are not available, the table-based dosing approaches (Table 1) are suggested. The range of doses by VKORC1 genotype and the range of dose recommendations/predictions by the FDA table and algorithm are shown in Figure 2.,  \newline

\item November 2013 Update \newline
\item CPIC guideline authors are aware of several recently published studies on warfarin pharmacogenetics PMID: 24251361, 24251363, 24251360. These papers have prompted several opinion pieces PMID: 24328463, 24251364. The authors are evaluating the information, which will be incorporated into the next update of the CPIC guideline on warfarin. \newline
\item October 2011 \newline
\item Advance online publication September 2011.  \newline
\item Guideline regarding the use of pharmacogenomic tests in dosing for warfarin was published in Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC(/contributors/consortia/cpicprofile.jsp)).   \newline
\item These guidelines are applicable to: \newline

\item Excerpt from the 2011 warfarin dosing guideline: \newline
\item Pharmacogenetic algorithm-based warfarin dosing: Numerous studies have derived warfarin dosing algorithms that use both genetic and non-genetic factors to predict warfarin dose PMID: 18305455, 19228618, 18574025. Two algorithms perform well in estimating stable warfarin dose across different ethnic populations,  PMID: 18305455, 19228618 these were created using more than 5,000 subjects. Dosing algorithms using genetics outperform nongenetic clinical algorithms and fixed-dose approaches in dose prediction PMID: 18305455, 19228618. The best way to estimate the anticipated stable dose of warfarin is to use the algorithms available on http://www.warfarindosing.org (offering both high-performing algorithms PMID: 18305455, 19228618). The dosing algorithm published by the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium is also online, at IWPC Pharmacogenetic Dosing Algorithm(https://github.com/PharmGKB/cpic-guidelines/raw/master/warfarin/2011/IWPCdosecalculator.xls). The two algorithms provide very similar dose recommendations.,  \newline
\item Approach to pharmacogenetic-based warfarin dosing without access to dosing algorithms:     In 2007, the FDA modified the warfarin label, stating that CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes may be useful in determining the optimal initial dose of warfarin PMID:17906972. The label was further updated in 2010 to include a table (Table 1) describing recommendations for initial dosing ranges for patients with different combinations of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes. Genetics-based algorithms also better predict warfarin dose than the FDA-approved warfarin label table PMID:21272753. Therefore, the use of pharmacogenetic algorithm-based dosing is recommended when possible, although if electronic means for such dosing are not available, the table-based dosing approaches (Table 1) are suggested. The range of doses by VKORC1 genotype and the range of dose recommendations/predictions by the FDA table and algorithm are shown in Figure 2.,  \newline

\item Figure 2 Legend: Frequency histograms of stable therapeutic warfarin doses in mg/week, stratified by VKORC1 -1639G&gt, A genotype in 3,616 patients recruited by the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium (IWPC) who did not carry the CYP2C9*2 or *3 allele (i.e., coded as *1/*1 for US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) table and algorithm dosing). The range of doses within each genotype group recommended on the FDA table is shown via the shaded rectangle. The range of doses predicted using the IWPC dosing algorithm in these 3,616 patients is shown by the solid lines. \newline
\item Figure 2 demonstrates that the range of individuals covered by the FDA table is much narrower than that of the algorithm. The article and supplement detail important variables that are not covered by the table that should also be taken into consideration. \newline
