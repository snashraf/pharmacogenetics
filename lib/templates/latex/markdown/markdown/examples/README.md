This directory contains example LaTeX and ConTeXt source files. These files can
be typeset by running the GNU `make` program in this directory. It is expected
that your TeX installation contains the `pdflatex`, `xelatex`, `lualatex`,
`texexec`, and `context` executables.

The file `tux.pdf` contains Tux, the Linux Mascot, by Larry Ewing
<lewing@isc.tamu.edu> (created in GIMP). As stated on the
