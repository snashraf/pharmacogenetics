\item These guidelines are applicable to: \newline
\item Adults \newline
\item At the time of this writing there are no pediatric data regarding associations between UGT1A1 genotypes and likelihood of bilirubin-related discontinuation of atazanavir. However, UGT1A1 genotypes are expected to affect atazanavir-related hyperbilirubinemia similarly in adults and children. Therefore, recommendations for adults may be directly adapted to pediatric patients. \newline

\item These guidelines are applicable to: \newline
\item at the time of this writing, there are no data available on the possible role of DPYD*2A, *13, or variant:rs67376798 in 5-fluorouracil toxicities in pediatric patient populations,  however, there is no reason to suspect that DPYD variant alleles would affect 5-fluorouracil metabolism differently in children compared to adults. \newline
\item Excerpt from the fluoropyrimidine dosing guideline based on DPYD genotype: \newline
\item The strength of the dosing recommendations is based on the fact that some variants (DPYD*2A, *13, and variant:rs67376798) clearly affect DPD activity, and DPD activity is clearly related to 5-fluorouracil clearance, and 5-fluorouracil exposure is associated with its toxic effects. Therefore, reduction of fluoropyrimidine dosage in patients with these variants may prevent severe and possibly life-threatening toxicities. However, available evidence does not clearly indicate a degree of dose reduction needed to prevent fluoropyrimidine related toxicities...Based on literature review (see full manuscript), our recommendation is to start with at least a 50\% reduction of the starting dose followed by an increase in dose in patients experiencing no or clinically tolerable toxicity to maintain efficacy, a decrease in dose in patients who do not tolerate the starting dose to minimize toxicities or pharmacokinetic guided dose adjustments (if available). Patients who are homozygous for DPYD*2A, *13, or variant:rs67376798 may demonstrate complete DPD deficiency and the use of 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine is not recommended in these patients.,   \newline

This is important because DPYD is on the minus chromosomal strand and variant:rs67376798 is a T/A snp.

\item The French joint working group comprising the National Pharmacogenetics Network (RNPGx) and the Group of Clinical Onco-pharmacology (GPCO-Unicancer) has published UGT1A1-based drug dosing guidelines for irinotecan in Fundamental &amp,  Clinical Pharmacology. Excerpts from , UGT1A1 genotype and irinotecan therapy: general review and implementation in routine practice,  PMID:25817555 follow: \newline
\item &gt,  ...we recommend pretreatment UGT1A1 genotyping of the TATA box (*28, *36, *37) for all patients scheduled to receive an irinotecan dose &gt, =180 mg/m2. The rare allele *36 (proficient) can be interpreted as an *1 allele and allele *37 (deficient) as an allele *28. \newline
\item &gt,  For low irinotecan doses (:180 mg/m2/week) UGT1A1 genotyping is not indicated as hematological and gastrointestinal toxicities are quite similar regardless of the genotype. \newline
\item &gt,  For initially scheduled doses between 180 and 230 mg/m2 every 2-3 weeks, *28/*28 patients are at increased risk of developing hematological and/or digestive toxicity as compared to other genotypes...a 25-30\% dose reduction at the first cycle is recommended, particularly in cases of associated risk factors (performance status &gt, 3). \newline
\item &gt,  For initially scheduled doses &gt, =240 mg/m2 every 2-3 weeks, *28/*28 patients are at a much higher risk of hematological toxicity (neutropenia) as compared to other genotypes. We thus recommend contraindicating such an intensified dose in *28/*28 patients. The administration of an intensified dose (240 mg/m2) is only possible in *1/*1 patients, as well as in *1/*28 patients, in the absence of additional risk factors and under strict medical surveillance. \newline
\item &gt,  This...analysis is limited by the fact that other UGT1A1 deficient variants are relevant in non-Caucasian populations, particularly the *6 and *27 alleles in Asian populations. \newline
\item The joint working group also provided a decision tree to guide irinotecan dosing based on UGT1A1 genotype: \newline

\item May 2016 Update on PharmGKB \newline
\item Since the most recent update to the CPIC ivacaftor dosing guideline in April 2014, the FDA-approved drug label(/label/PA166104890) has been updated again to include the variant R117H (variant:rs78655421). In light of this change, the CPIC guideline annotation on this PharmGKB webpage has been updated to include this additional CFTR variant (see Table 1 and Figure 1, below). This variant is not discussed in the 2014 guideline publication. Additionally, the updated drug label indicates ivacaftor use for patients 2 years and older,  previously it was indicated only for patients 6 years and older.  \newline
\item April 2014 Update on PharmGKB \newline
\item After the submission and review of the CPIC guideline manuscript, the FDA-approved drug label(/label/PA166104890) for ivacaftor was updated to include additional variants. In light of these changes, the CPIC guideline annotation on this PharmGKB webpage has been updated to include additional CFTR variants, specifically G1244E (variant:rs267606723), G1349D (variant:rs193922525), G178R (variant:rs80282562), G551S (variant:rs121909013), S1251N (variant:rs74503330), S1255P (variant:rs121909041), S549N (variant:rs121908755) and S549R (variant:rs121908757 and variant:rs121909005) (see Table 1 and Figure 1, below).  These variants are not discussed in the 2014 guideline publication. \newline

\item Adapted from Table 2 of the 2014 guideline manuscript (May 2016 Update on PharmGKB).  Variants have been added to the table below that are not in the published 2014 guideline or supplement,  specifically, variants other than G551D and F508del. \newline
\item a These recommendations are based on treatment of CF patients with ivacaftor alone and current evidence. Clinical trials are currently underway to investigate ivacaftor alone or in combination with other drugs to treat CF patients with CFTR variants other than G551D, therefore there is potential that ivacaftor may be effective in these patients. See the 2014 guidelines for further details. \newline
\item b The recommendation for patients with the F508del/F508del genotype is based on ivacaftor mechanism of action and clinical observational data. The clinical study however was a safety study and was not powered to detect a difference in efficacy PMID: 22383668. \newline
\item c Rating scheme described in the 2014 supplement. \newline
\item d Variants listed in this table include those added to the updated drug label for ivacaftor(/label/PA166104890). The modifications to this table were made after the acceptance of publication of the 2014 CPIC Ivacaftor-CFTR guideline PMID: 24598717 and are not reflected in the PDFs of the CPIC guideline main manuscript or supplement.  \newline
\item Figure 1: Treatment algorithm for clinical use of Ivacaftor for cystic fibrosis patients based on CFTR genotype. \newline
\item Adapted from Figure 1 of the 2014 guideline manuscript (May 2016 Update on PharmGKB).  Variants have been added to this figure that are not in the published 2014 guideline or supplement,  specifically, variants other than G551D and F508del. Additionally, the age has been updated to 2 years old or older from 6 years and older, due to an update in the FDA-approved drug label for ivacaftor. \newline
\item !Adapted diagram from Figure 1(IvacaftorFigure1May2016Update.png) \newline
\item e Ivacaftor is not recommended for CF patients with other CFTR variants or in patients homozygous for the F508del variant (see 2014 guideline for further details, supporting evidence and disclaimers). Future clinical trials for other CFTR variants are ongoing. \newline

\item Excerpt from the 2013 PEG-interferon-alpha therapy dosing guidelines: \newline
\item The role of IFNL3 genotyping depends on treatment selection. IFNL3 genotype is only one factor that could influence response rates to PEG-IFN alpha and RBV therapy in HCV genotype 1 infection and should be interpreted in the context of other clinical and genetic factors. ,  \newline
\item For patients treated with PEG-IFN alpha and RBV alone, IFNL3 genotype is the strongest pretreatment predictor of HCV treatment response. In the intention to treat analysis of the original discovery cohort with variant:rs12979860, Caucasian CC genotype patients were more likely than CT or TT patients to be undetectable by week 4 (28\% versus 5\% and 5\%, P:0.0001) and to achieve SVR (69\% versus 33\% and 27\%, P:0.0001). Similar patterns were observed in Hispanic and African American patients in this cohort. HCV treatment is associated with significant side effects, and the likelihood of response treatment influences shared decision making between clinicians and patients about initiating treatment.,   \newline
\item For treatment naïve patients with genotype 1 infection who are treated with protease inhibitor combinations, all IFNL3 genotypes have improved response rates compared to PEG-IFN alpha and RBV only. However, patients with the favorable IFNL3 genotype still have higher response rates with the protease inhibitor combination in treatment naïve patients, and these response rates may guide patients and clinicians in their treatment decisions. In the boceprevir phase 3 naïve study of combination with PEG-IFN alpha and RBV, SVR rates for variant:rs12979860 CC patients receiving boceprevir ranged from 80-82\% compared to 65-71\% for CT patients and 59-65\% for TT patients. Moreover, multivariate regression analysis revealed that variant:rs12979860 CC was a predictor of SVR compared to CT (odds ratio (OR) 2.6, 95\% CI 1.3-5.1) and TT genotypes (OR 2.1, 95\% CI 1.2-3.7).,  \newline

In the intention to treat analysis of the original discovery cohort with variant:rs12979860, Caucasian CC genotype patients were more likely than CT or TT patients to be undetectable by week 4 (28\% versus 5\% and 5\%, P:0.0001) and to achieve SVR (69\% versus 33\% and 27\%, P:0.0001). Similar patterns were observed in Hispanic and African American patients in this cohort. HCV treatment is associated with significant side effects, and the likelihood of response treatment influences shared decision making between clinicians and patients about initiating treatment.,   \newline
\item For treatment naïve patients with genotype 1 infection who are treated with protease inhibitor combinations, all IFNL3 genotypes have improved response rates compared to PEG-IFN alpha and RBV only. However, patients with the favorable IFNL3 genotype still have higher response rates with the protease inhibitor combination in treatment naïve patients, and these response rates may guide patients and clinicians in their treatment decisions. In the boceprevir phase 3 naïve study of combination with PEG-IFN alpha and RBV, SVR rates for variant:rs12979860 CC patients receiving boceprevir ranged from 80-82\% compared to 65-71\% for CT patients and 59-65\% for TT patients. Moreover, multivariate regression analysis revealed that variant:rs12979860 CC was a predictor of SVR compared to CT (odds ratio (OR) 2.6, 95\% CI 1.3-5.1) and TT genotypes (OR 2.1, 95\% CI 1.2-3.7).,  \newline

\item Excerpts from the 2015 tacrolimus dosing guidelines: \newline
\item Blood concentrations of tacrolimus are strongly influenced by CYP3A5 genotype, with substantial evidence linking CYP3A5 genotype with phenotypic variability...In kidney, heart and lung transplant patients, over 50 studies have found that individuals with the CYP3A5*1/*1 or CYP3A5*1/*3 genotype have significantly lower dose-adjusted trough concentrations of tacrolimus as compared to those with the CYP3A5*3/*3 genotype...,  \newline
\item Those recipients with an extensive or intermediate metabolizer phenotype will generally require an increased dose of tacrolimus to achieve therapeutic drug concentrations. We recommend a dose 1.5 - 2 times higher than standard dosing, but not to exceed 0.3 mg/kg/day, followed by therapeutic drug monitoring given the risk of arterial vasoconstriction, hypertension and nephrotoxicity that can occur with supratherapeutic tacrolimus concentrations.,   \newline

\item Table 1: Dosing recommendations for tacrolimus based on CYP3A5 phenotype: \newline
\item Adapted from Tables 1 and 2 of the 2015 guideline manuscript. \newline
\item a Typically with other CYP enzymes, an extensive metabolizer would be classified as a “normal” metabolizer, and therefore, the drug dose would not change based on the patient’s genotype. However, in the case of CYP3A5 and tacrolimus, a CYP3A5 expresser (i.e. CYP3A5 extensive metabolizer or intermediate metabolizer) would require a higher recommended starting dose and the CYP3A5 non-expresser (i.e. poor metabolizer) would require the standard recommended starting dose. \newline
\item b Additional rare variants such as CYP3A5*2, *8, and *9 may be found which are of unknown functional significance. However, if a copy of *1 is present, expected phenotype would be intermediate metabolizer. \newline
\item c This recommendation includes the use of tacrolimus in kidney, heart, lung and hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients, and liver transplant patients where the donor and recipient genotypes are identical. \newline
\item d Further dose adjustments or selection of alternative therapy may be necessary due to other clinical factors (e.g., medication interactions, or hepatic function) \newline

\item Guidelines regarding the use of pharmacogenomic tests in dosing for fluoropyrimidines have been published in Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC(/contributors/consortia/cpicprofile.jsp)). \newline
\item These guidelines are applicable to: \newline
\item at the time of this writing, there are no data available on the possible role of DPYD*2A, *13, or variant:rs67376798 in 5-fluorouracil toxicities in pediatric patient populations,  however, there is no reason to suspect that DPYD variant alleles would affect 5-fluorouracil metabolism differently in children compared to adults. \newline
\item Excerpt from the fluoropyrimidine dosing guideline based on DPYD genotype: \newline
\item The strength of the dosing recommendations is based on the fact that some variants (DPYD*2A, *13, and variant:rs67376798) clearly affect DPD activity, and DPD activity is clearly related to 5-fluorouracil clearance, and 5-fluorouracil exposure is associated with its toxic effects. Therefore, reduction of fluoropyrimidine dosage in patients with these variants may prevent severe and possibly life-threatening toxicities. However, available evidence does not clearly indicate a degree of dose reduction needed to prevent fluoropyrimidine related toxicities...Based on literature review (see full manuscript), our recommendation is to start with at least a 50\% reduction of the starting dose followed by an increase in dose in patients experiencing no or clinically tolerable toxicity to maintain efficacy, a decrease in dose in patients who do not tolerate the starting dose to minimize toxicities or pharmacokinetic guided dose adjustments (if available). Patients who are homozygous for DPYD*2A, *13, or variant:rs67376798 may demonstrate complete DPD deficiency and the use of 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine is not recommended in these patients.,   \newline

\item b Increase the dose in patients experiencing no or clinically tolerable toxicity to maintain efficacy,  decrease the dose in patients who do not tolerate the starting dose to minimize toxicities. \newline
\item c Note that the rs67376798A allele refers to the allele on the positive chromosomal strand.  This is important because DPYD is on the minus chromosomal strand and variant:rs67376798 is a T/A snp.  Therefore, the T allele on the gene confers the deficiency, while the complement on the positive chromosomal strand (A allele) is indicative of deficiency. \newline

\item Excerpt from the 2011 warfarin dosing guideline: \newline
\item Pharmacogenetic algorithm-based warfarin dosing: Numerous studies have derived warfarin dosing algorithms that use both genetic and non-genetic factors to predict warfarin dose PMID: 18305455, 19228618, 18574025. Two algorithms perform well in estimating stable warfarin dose across different ethnic populations,  PMID: 18305455, 19228618 these were created using more than 5,000 subjects. Dosing algorithms using genetics outperform nongenetic clinical algorithms and fixed-dose approaches in dose prediction PMID: 18305455, 19228618. The best way to estimate the anticipated stable dose of warfarin is to use the algorithms available on http://www.warfarindosing.org (offering both high-performing algorithms PMID: 18305455, 19228618). The dosing algorithm published by the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium is also online, at IWPC Pharmacogenetic Dosing Algorithm(https://github.com/PharmGKB/cpic-guidelines/raw/master/warfarin/2011/IWPCdosecalculator.xls). The two algorithms provide very similar dose recommendations.,  \newline
\item Approach to pharmacogenetic-based warfarin dosing without access to dosing algorithms:     In 2007, the FDA modified the warfarin label, stating that CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes may be useful in determining the optimal initial dose of warfarin PMID:17906972. The label was further updated in 2010 to include a table (Table 1) describing recommendations for initial dosing ranges for patients with different combinations of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes. Genetics-based algorithms also better predict warfarin dose than the FDA-approved warfarin label table PMID:21272753. Therefore, the use of pharmacogenetic algorithm-based dosing is recommended when possible, although if electronic means for such dosing are not available, the table-based dosing approaches (Table 1) are suggested. The range of doses by VKORC1 genotype and the range of dose recommendations/predictions by the FDA table and algorithm are shown in Figure 2.,  \newline
