If this document has compiled and your tree looks okay, then \textsf{newicktree} has been successfully installed on your system!

If the document compiled but the tree does not look okay, then it is possible that you are using a dvi preview to view / print the document.  Please use a dvi-ps converter (preferably dvips) to generate a PostScript file, and try looking at that.

\begin{newicktree}
\drawtree{((My:1,first:1.5):0.5,(\sf newicktree:2,tree!:2.5):0.5):0.5;}
\end{newicktree}
